# Text classification tensorflow pretrained word2vec embedding bidirectional RNN model

## Navigatie Code

This code uses a pretrained word2vec embedding with a biderictional layers with tensorflow.

### download_embedding.sh

Only change this file if you would like to change the trained embedding layer.

It downloads the the embedding layer and uses environment variables defined in dockerfile for later when training the model.

If you would like to change embedding dim, please change it from the docker file ENV embed_dim=*** , availabe dim for this trained embedding are: 100, 300, and 500.

### app:

Is where all of code used to run train, test or serve modules.

config.py: is a file to determine main configurations such as files paths used during preprocessing, training, serving.

inference_app.py: is a file that declare infer/ping and predictions to requested data happens.

#### Utils:

Utils consist of:

1- preprocess folder: has the preprocess classes to process data according to schema.

2- model_builder.py: where the Machine Learning model defined, built, and loaded.

3- predictions_handler.py: called when needed a prediction for inference or testing/predic.

4- utils.py: general functions to help such as load json files.

#### train

python file, called to start training on the required dataset and saves trained model to be called later during inference or during testing.

#### predict

python file, called to generate test.csv file to test model preformance after training.

#### serve

python file, called to generate inferences in production on your server, listens to port 8080.

## Model architecture

Model architecture can be defined using hyperparameters.json file located at app/opt/ml_vol/model/model_config.

model consist of GRU RNN layers wrapped with bidirictional layer, number of layers can be defined in hyperparameters.json file that should be in "model/model_config/" folder.

{

"epochs":10, #Defines for how long to train the model.

"num_layers":2, #Defines number of Bidirectional Layers.

"neurons_num":50, #Defines number of neurons for each layer.

"embed_lay_output":120, #Defines the output dimension of the embedding layer "Not trained".

"learning_rate":0.01 #Defines the learning rate passed to Adam optimizer.

}

Each of parameters must be passed to build the model.
